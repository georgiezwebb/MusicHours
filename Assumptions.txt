Assumptions:

1. When the schedule is complete, songs follow songs
2. When the schedule is complete there is no more than one bulletin per hour, all bulletins are proceeded and followed
by songs
3. Length of the schedule is derived from the total length of all transmissions
4. Not all bulletins may be included in the schedule if there are more bulletins than one per hour
5. Since bulletins cannot interrupt songs and have to begin with in a window of 120 before, and complete 120 seconds
after a song, one hour might not contain a bulletin if it is not possible to include it in that window.
6. All schedules start on the hour (i.e. 10 a.m., 12 p.m., etc.)
7. Mapping of the song list to the Transmission object is handled outside ScheduleGenerator, Transmission objects are
valid at when createSchedule() is called.
8.If maximum length of a song is 240 seconds, a minimum of 14 ((3600 - 120)/240 = 14.5) songs can be added to an hour
before the news bulletin window.
